      <p>If your employer signs up to Thadle for Work, we will receive your  information from your employer,

        <p>If you have placed an order with us or signed up to Thadle, we use your information to send you 
          marketing communications by post, email, mobile messaging (such as SMS, MMS, WhatsApp and push 
          notifications) and by phone, as well as to show you advertising online.</p>
        <p>At Thadle, we use your account, device and usage information, order details and how you have paid, 
          your preferences and demographic information to send you personalised offers and updates and to 
          show you advertising about great restaurants, shops, products and services we think you 
          would like.</p>
        <p>Through our marketing communications we want to keep you up-to-date about the products, services 
          and initiatives that we believe may interest you. This includes our latest offers and updates 
          about Thadle, Thadle for Work, and our Partners that are most relevant to you based on your 
          information as mentioned above.</p>
        <p>You can opt-out or change your marketing preferences at any time:</p>
        <p>Online or in-app: Visit www.thadle.com or our mobile app, click on ‘Account’ (in-app this is

          ‘Notifications’.</p>
        <p><div id="automated"><b>7. Use of automated systems</b></div></p>
        <p>We use automated systems to detect and prevent fraud and abuses of our Sites and to manage 
          customer operations and key elements of our contract with you.</p>
        <p>We also undertake fraud checks on all customers, which is necessary for us to:</p>
        <p><ul><li>provide our contracted services to you; </li></ul></p>
        <p><ul><li>ensure that our services (and those of all our partners) are duly paid for;</li></ul></p>
        <p><ul><li>ensure that customers themselves are protected from fraudulent transactions being made 
          on their payment cards.</li></ul></p>
        <p>For example, we look to verify whether online payments on our platform are authentic, whether 
          vouchers and promotional codes are being used appropriately, consider whether a refund is due 
          and to protect against account takeovers and unauthorised by-passing of our fraud controls.</p>
        <p>The fraud checks look at various components, including known industry indicators of fraud which 
          our expert fraud detection provider makes available to us, as well as fraud patterns we have 
          detected on our Sites. When combined, these help us to assess the likelihood of fraudulent 
          activity on our Sites. Where we believe there may be fraudulent activity we may decide not 
          to give a refund or may block you from placing an order or from using our Sites in future. 
          The specific fraud indicators are dynamic so will change depending on what types of fraud 
          are being detected in the industry, country and our Sites at any particular time.</p>
        <p>Our fraud checks are in place to protect our customers, as well as Thadle. You have the right 
          to query, and our customer support will look into any decision you feel may have been caught 
          by our fraud checks that have impacted you by contacting us using our contact form 
          available&nbsp;<a href="https://thadle.com/contact">here.</a></p>

        <p>We will only retain your information for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes 
          we collected it for, and for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting 
          or reporting requirements. In the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a 
          prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you, we may retain your information

          United Kingdom (UK) or European Economic Area (EEA) to help us provide our services, or other 
          countries where we may have operations.</p>
        <p>If we transfer your information to another country that does not, under their local laws, offer 
          an equivalent standard of data protection to the UK or EEA, we will make sure that your 
          information is protected. For example, we will only transfer your information:</p>
        <p><ul><li>to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for 
          personal information; or</li></ul></p>
        <p><ul><li>where we can enter into contracts with third parties ensuring that strict data protection 
          safeguards are in place before we transfer your information.</li></ul></p>
        <p>If you have any questions about the specific mechanisms used, please contact us (to learn more, 
          check the “Contact details” section above).</p>
        <p>If you use Thadle services in another country where we operate, for example, when you are 
          travelling, your information will be processed in accordance with the applicable laws of that 
          country and the Thadle privacy policy of that country will apply.</p>
        <p><div id="security"><b>11. Security</b></div></p>
        <p>We adopt robust technologies and policies to protect your information from being accidentally 
          lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access 
          to your information to those riders, third party providers and Thadle employees who have a 
          business need-to-know.</p>
        <p>For example, we protect your information when we share it, including through encryption, we 
          test and evaluate our systems regularly and conduct security assessments of our third party 
          providers we engage to ensure they meet our rigorous security standards.</p>
        <p>Although we take steps to keep your information secure when it is with us, transmitting data over 
          the internet is never fully secure, so any information you send to our Sites is done at your 
          own risk.</p>
        <p>When you create an account with Thadle you may create a password, or other secure login method 
          and also provide payment card details. You must use a unique password and keep any password you 
          create or other secure login method secret in order to help prevent others from accessing your 
          account.</p>
        <p><div id="rights"><b>12. Your rights</b></div></p>
        <p>You have certain rights over the information we hold about you. These rights can help you control 
          the way we use your information.</p>
        <p>You have the right to:</p>
        <p><ul><li><b>Access your information</b>. You can ask us for a copy of the information we hold about you 
          and to check whether we are processing it lawfully. In sharing with you a copy of your information, 
          we use a third party secure method of transfer.</li></ul></p>
        <p><ul><li><b>Change or update your information</b>. You can update your information, such as your name, 
          phone number, delivery address and payment method in-app in the “Account” section. You can also 
          ask us to make changes to any information we hold about you if that is incorrect or outdated, 
          but we may need to verify the accuracy of the new information before updating it.</li></ul></p>
        <p><ul><li><b>Delete your account</b>. You can delete your account and any personal information associated 
          with it by logging into your account on our website or app, clicking “here” and then fill the 
          form to demand the “Delete Account” action. There may be specific details that we are legally 
          obliged or have a compelling legitimate reason to keep and therefore need to keep for a 
          longer period.</li></ul></p>
        <p><ul><li><b>Portability of your information</b>. You can ask us for a copy of your information 
        in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and, if we can, to send this to a third 
        party. This right only applies to automated information that you have provided to us, which you 
        initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract 
        with you.</li></ul></p>
        <p><ul><li><b>Withdraw your consent</b>. Where we rely on consent to use your information, you can 
        withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawing consent will not, however, make unlawful our 
        use of your information before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may 
        not be able to provide certain services to you.</li></ul></p>
        <p><ul><li><b>Object to the use of your information</b>. You can opt out of any marketing 
        communications that we may send you and object to us using your information if we have no legitimate 
        reasons to do so.</li></ul></p>
        <p><ul><li><b>Restrict our use of your information</b>. In certain circumstances, you can ask us to 
        suspend our handling of your information if you have a specific reason for doing so. For example, 
        if you are unhappy with the way we have used your information you can ask us to stop using it 
        until we have addressed your concerns.</li></ul></p>
        <p><ul><li><b>Human intervention</b>. If we make a solely automated decision about you that has a 
        legal or similarly significant impact on you, you can ask us to carry out a manual review of this 
        decision.</li></ul></p>
        <p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact our Data Protection Officer at 
          franthad@hotmail.com. We may need to ask you to verify your identity before we can respond to 
          your request.</p>
        <p>If you are unhappy with how we have handled your information you can contact your local data 
          protection authority. We would, however, really appreciate the chance to deal with your 
          concerns before you approach your local data protection authority and so we please ask that 
          you contact us first.</p>

        <p>We may update this policy from time to time, so remember to check back in every so often, in case

          in-app notification. </p>
